# yeetbot Discord Bot

A simple to setup WIP entertainment discord.js bot

First download to your pc, or clone from glitch, whitchever you choose

Run `npm install` in your terminal, command prompt or glitch's terminal, again depending on what you are using

Put your token into token.json

Next edit prefix.json and change the prefix whatever you want (Deafult is !!)

And finaily add your user id to `global.admins` which is at the bottom of index.js (NOTE: Do not edit the userids in `global.devs`, it will screw up the bot!)

Line 30 of index.js has set status, change it to your will! (WATCHING, PLAYING, LISTENING, STREAMING)
